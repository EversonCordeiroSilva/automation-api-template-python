# core

This folder is reserved for framework-level concerns that may emerge as the project evolves.

Examples of potential responsibilities:
- shared HTTP client
- retry and resiliency mechanisms
- authentication handling
- logging and observability

No core abstractions were introduced yet to avoid unnecessary complexity.
